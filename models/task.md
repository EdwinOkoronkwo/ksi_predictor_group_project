1. Data exploration: a complete review and analysis of the dataset including:

    - (Person 1) Load and describe data elements (columns), provide descriptions & types, ranges and values of elements as appropriate. – use pandas, numpy and any other python packages.
      Statistical assessments including means, averages, correlations

    - (Person 2) Missing data evaluations – use pandas, numpy and any other python packages
      Data transformations – includes handling missing data, categorical data management, data normalization and standardizations as needed.
    
    **** Graphs and visualizations – use pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy and any other python packages, you also can use power BI desktop.

2. Data modelling:

    
    - (Person 3) Feature selection – use pandas and sci-kit learn. (The group needs to justify each feature used and any data columns discarded)
    
    - (Person 4) Train, Test data splitting – use numpy, sci-kit learn.
       Managing imbalanced classes if needed. Check here for info: https://elitedatascience.com/imbalanced-classes
    

    - (Person 5) Use pipelines class to streamline all the pre-processing transformations.
